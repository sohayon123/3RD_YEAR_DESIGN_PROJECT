# 3RD_YEAR_DESIGN_PROJECT
3rd year autonomous maze robot

Designed the electrical system for a robot that can autonomously navigate a course with various traps and obstacles. Grades were awarded for completing the course quickly, and for having a low-mass robot. For this reason, my group went for a simple mechanical design with the bare minimum in terms of electronics.
